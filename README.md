## 🚀 What is NodeClash?

NodeClash is a high-octane, real-time multiplayer competitive coding platform. Think of it as a battleground where developers go head-to-head to solve Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems. But there's a twist: **An AI Interviewer is watching**. 

Mid-battle, the AI analyzes your code and injects dynamic, real-time constraints (e.g., *"Solve this without using any built-in methods!"*), pushing your adaptability and problem-solving skills to the absolute limit.

## 🔥 Epic Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⚔️ Live 1v1 Battles** | Real-time matchmaking and bidirectional code execution powered by Socket.io. See your opponent's progress live. |
| **🤖 AI Interviewer** | Integrated with **Groq** & **Google Gemini API** to analyze code logic and throw sudden constraints mid-game. |
| **🏆 ELO Ranking System** | A highly competitive global leaderboard. Start at `Bronze` and fight your way up to `Grandmaster` (4000+ ELO). |
| **💻 Pro-Grade Editor** | Embedded **Monaco Editor** (the engine behind VS Code). Supports JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java with auto-complete. |
| **🧠 Practice Mode** | Not ready for ranked? Spar against a smart AI Bot to warm up your logic before hitting the live arena. |

## 💻 Local Installation & Setup

Want to run the battleground on your local machine? Let's get you set up.

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Prajwal-Dhande/NodeClash.git](https://github.com/Prajwal-Dhande/NodeClash.git)
cd NodeClash
```

### 2. Ignite the Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```
Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Launch the Frontend
Open a new terminal window:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and enter the arena.
